# CaRaksha

Caraksha is a portable, low-cost safety device designed to enhance driver and road safety by addressing the three main causes of car accidents in India: distracted driving, drunk driving, and overspeeding. Integrated into a car's entertainment console, it uses sensors, cameras, and real-time alerts to prevent accidents and provide emergency support.

Key Features:

Overspeeding Prevention: Buzzers alert drivers exceeding speed limits.
Drunk Driving Detection: Ethanol sensors trigger beeping and send SOS to emergency contacts.
Distracted Driving Monitoring: Camera detects if the driver falls asleep or looks away, activating a buzzer.
Accident Response: Displays driver health info (e.g., blood group, allergies) on an LCD screen and sends SOS to family and nearby hospitals via GPS.
Road Mapping: External camera with Python-based video processing identifies obstacles, potholes, and road quality, aiding government road surveys.
Inter-Vehicle Safety: Syncs with nearby Caraksha-equipped vehicles to prevent rear-end collisions during hard braking.
Components:

Arduino (image processing), Raspberry Pi (video processing), GPS tracker, ultrasonic sensors, ethanol sensor, camera, buzzer, LCD screen, GSM module, and more.
Estimated Cost: ~₹14,000 (including manufacturing).

Purpose:

Caraksha aims to reduce road accidents, save lives, and assist in infrastructure development by providing real-time road data. It’s portable for use in both new and old vehicles.
